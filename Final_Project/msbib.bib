    abstract = {{We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 \&lt;= z \&lt;= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The
distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 \&lt; 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M \&gt;= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0
\&lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 \&gt;= 0.}},

@article{betoule2014,
    abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis
of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and
SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples
(z\&lt; 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 \&lt;z\&lt; 0.4),
and three years from SNLS (0.2 \&lt;z\&lt; 1), and it totals 740
spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high-quality light
curves. <BR /> Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the
SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important
improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II
spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the
SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2)
intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic
uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with
respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of
systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light
curves. <BR /> Results: We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and
associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II
sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble
diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in
the low-z SN sample. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find
Omega<SUB>m</SUB> =0.295 \&\#177; 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent
with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from
the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma (stat+sys)
different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data.
The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric
calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant
dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 \&\#177; 0.057
(stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation
distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 \&\#177;
0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints
to date on the nature of dark energy.<p/>

need to coordinate high-stakes analyses using multiple methods; furthermore
such analyses have grown in complexity due to sophisticated models of cosmology
and systematic uncertainties. In this paper we argue that modularity is the key
to addressing these challenges: calculations should be broken up into
interchangeable modular units with inputs and outputs clearly defined. We
present a new framework for cosmological parameter estimation, CosmoSIS,
designed to connect together, share, and advance development of inference tools
across the community. We describe the modules already available in CosmoSIS,
including CAMB, Planck, cosmic shear calculations, and a suite of samplers. We
illustrate it using demonstration code that you can run out-of-the-box with the

Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of
on-site measurements of the instrument response function and
observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the
systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\%
without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope
Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed
with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality
cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light
curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming
a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields

@article{weinberg2013,
    abstract = {{The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising
cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated
by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that
Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound
implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental
efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with
percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well
established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters.
We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques
and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage
IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We
briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space
distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H\_0. We
present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of
state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage
IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and
CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to
provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We
emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most
powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties
and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic
acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the
longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater
detail over ever larger scales.}},
